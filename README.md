# GenL
X-ray reflectivity and diffraction fitting tool for single crystal films

Folder kinematic includes a graphical user interface for fitting single layers and a command line version where more complicated structures can be fitted.

Binaries:

Binary is available for MacOS Ventura, Windows 10 and Windows 11. in kinematic/binaries

When running the installer, the free MATLAB runtime environment will be installed and the application appears in Applications.

When running the application for the first time, it may take a couple of minutes to start.

Once the program starts, choose the working folder (on mac OS: default is /Applications/GenL/application/).


Folder kinematic_and_dynamic includes a command line version that can do either kinematic or dynamic diffraction including fitting.

We recommend starting with the kinematic version to get a rough fit and then switching to the dynamic for higher accuracy.

Superlattice can be modeled using the engine without the GUI.
